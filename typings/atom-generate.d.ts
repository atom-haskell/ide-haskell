     * this class via `atom.commands`, and commands registered there will be
     * presented in the command palette.
     *
     * The global command registry facilitates a style of event handling known as
     * *event delegation* that was popularized by jQuery. Atom commands are expressed
     * as custom DOM events that can be invoked on the currently focused element via
     * a key binding or manually via the command palette. Rather than binding
     * listeners for command events directly to DOM nodes, you instead register
     * command event listeners globally on `atom.commands` and constrain them to
     * specific kinds of elements with CSS selectors.
     *
     * Command names must follow the `namespace:action` pattern, where `namespace`
     * will typically be the name of your package, and `action` describes the
     * behavior of your command. If either part consists of multiple words, these
     * must be separated by hyphens. E.g. `awesome-package:turn-it-up-to-eleven`.
     * All words should be lowercased.
     *
     * As the event bubbles upward through the DOM, all registered event listeners
     * with matching selectors are invoked in order of specificity. In the event of a
     * specificity tie, the most recently registered listener is invoked first. This
     * mirrors the "cascade" semantics of CSS. Event listeners are invoked in the
     * context of the current DOM node, meaning `this` always points at
     * `event.currentTarget`. As is normally the case with DOM events,
     * `stopPropagation` and `stopImmediatePropagation` can be used to terminate the
     * bubbling process and prevent invocation of additional listeners.
     *
     * ## Example
     *
     * Here is a command that inserts the current date in an editor:
     *
     * ```coffee
     * atom.commands.add 'atom-text-editor',
     *   'user:insert-date': (event) ->
     *     editor = @getModel()
     *     editor.insertText(new Date().toLocaleString())
     * ```

    /**
     * Used to access all of Atom's configuration details.
     *
     * An instance of this class is always available as the `atom.config` global.
     *
     * ## Getting and setting config settings.
     *
     * ```coffee
     * # Note that with no value set, ::get returns the setting's default value.
     * atom.config.get('my-package.myKey') # -> 'defaultValue'
     *
     * atom.config.set('my-package.myKey', 'value')
     * atom.config.get('my-package.myKey') # -> 'value'
     * ```
     *
     * You may want to watch for changes. Use {::observe} to catch changes to the setting.
     *
     * ```coffee
     * atom.config.set('my-package.myKey', 'value')
     * atom.config.observe 'my-package.myKey', (newValue) ->
     *   # `observe` calls immediately and every time the value is changed
     *   console.log 'My configuration changed:', newValue
     * ```
     *
     * If you want a notification only when the value changes, use {::onDidChange}.
     *
     * ```coffee
     * atom.config.onDidChange 'my-package.myKey', ({newValue, oldValue}) ->
     *   console.log 'My configuration changed:', newValue, oldValue
     * ```
     *
     * ### Value Coercion
     *
     * Config settings each have a type specified by way of a
     * [schema](json-schema.org). For example we might an integer setting that only
     * allows integers greater than `0`:
     *
     * ```coffee
     * # When no value has been set, `::get` returns the setting's default value
     * atom.config.get('my-package.anInt') # -> 12
     *
     * # The string will be coerced to the integer 123
     * atom.config.set('my-package.anInt', '123')
     * atom.config.get('my-package.anInt') # -> 123
     *
     * # The string will be coerced to an integer, but it must be greater than 0, so is set to 1
     * atom.config.set('my-package.anInt', '-20')
     * atom.config.get('my-package.anInt') # -> 1
     * ```
     *
     * ## Defining settings for your package
     *
     * Define a schema under a `config` key in your package main.
     *
     * ```coffee
     * module.exports =
     *   # Your config schema
     *   config:
     *     someInt:
     *       type: 'integer'
     *       default: 23
     *       minimum: 1
     *
     *   activate: (state) -> # ...
     *   # ...
     * ```
     *
     * See [package docs](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/package-word-count/) for
     * more info.
     *
     * ## Config Schemas
     *
     * We use [json schema](http://json-schema.org) which allows you to define your value's
     * default, the type it should be, etc. A simple example:
     *
     * ```coffee
     * # We want to provide an `enableThing`, and a `thingVolume`
     * config:
     *   enableThing:
     *     type: 'boolean'
     *     default: false
     *   thingVolume:
     *     type: 'integer'
     *     default: 5
     *     minimum: 1
     *     maximum: 11
     * ```
     *
     * The type keyword allows for type coercion and validation. If a `thingVolume` is
     * set to a string `'10'`, it will be coerced into an integer.
     *
     * ```coffee
     * atom.config.set('my-package.thingVolume', '10')
     * atom.config.get('my-package.thingVolume') # -> 10
     *
     * # It respects the min / max
     * atom.config.set('my-package.thingVolume', '400')
     * atom.config.get('my-package.thingVolume') # -> 11
     *
     * # If it cannot be coerced, the value will not be set
     * atom.config.set('my-package.thingVolume', 'cats')
     * atom.config.get('my-package.thingVolume') # -> 11
     * ```
     *
     * ### Supported Types
     *
     * The `type` keyword can be a string with any one of the following. You can also
     * chain them by specifying multiple in an an array. For example
     *
     * ```coffee
     * config:
     *   someSetting:
     *     type: ['boolean', 'integer']
     *     default: 5
     *
     * # Then
     * atom.config.set('my-package.someSetting', 'true')
     * atom.config.get('my-package.someSetting') # -> true
     *
     * atom.config.set('my-package.someSetting', '12')
     * atom.config.get('my-package.someSetting') # -> 12
     * ```
     *
     * #### string
     *
     * Values must be a string.
     *
     * ```coffee
     * config:
     *   someSetting:
     *     type: 'string'
     *     default: 'hello'
     * ```
     *
     * #### integer
     *
     * Values will be coerced into integer. Supports the (optional) `minimum` and
     * `maximum` keys.
     *
     * ```coffee
     *   config:
     *     someSetting:
     *       type: 'integer'
     *       default: 5
     *       minimum: 1
     *       maximum: 11
     * ```
     *
     * #### number
     *
     * Values will be coerced into a number, including real numbers. Supports the
     * (optional) `minimum` and `maximum` keys.
     *
     * ```coffee
     * config:
     *   someSetting:
     *     type: 'number'
     *     default: 5.3
     *     minimum: 1.5
     *     maximum: 11.5
     * ```
     *
     * #### boolean
     *
     * Values will be coerced into a Boolean. `'true'` and `'false'` will be coerced into
     * a boolean. Numbers, arrays, objects, and anything else will not be coerced.
     *
     * ```coffee
     * config:
     *   someSetting:
     *     type: 'boolean'
     *     default: false
     * ```
     *
     * #### array
     *
     * Value must be an Array. The types of the values can be specified by a
     * subschema in the `items` key.
     *
     * ```coffee
     * config:
     *   someSetting:
     *     type: 'array'
     *     default: [1, 2, 3]
     *     items:
     *       type: 'integer'
     *       minimum: 1.5
     *       maximum: 11.5
     * ```
     *
     * #### color
     *
     * Values will be coerced into a {Color} with `red`, `green`, `blue`, and `alpha`
     * properties that all have numeric values. `red`, `green`, `blue` will be in
     * the range 0 to 255 and `value` will be in the range 0 to 1. Values can be any
     * valid CSS color format such as `#abc`, `#abcdef`, `white`,
     * `rgb(50, 100, 150)`, and `rgba(25, 75, 125, .75)`.
     *
     * ```coffee
     * config:
     *   someSetting:
     *     type: 'color'
     *     default: 'white'
     * ```
     *
     * #### object / Grouping other types
     *
     * A config setting with the type `object` allows grouping a set of config
     * settings. The group will be visualy separated and has its own group headline.
     * The sub options must be listed under a `properties` key.
     *
     * ```coffee
     * config:
     *   someSetting:
     *     type: 'object'
     *     properties:
     *       myChildIntOption:
     *         type: 'integer'
     *         minimum: 1.5
     *         maximum: 11.5
     * ```
     *
     * ### Other Supported Keys
     *
     * #### enum
     *
     * All types support an `enum` key, which lets you specify all the values the
     * setting can take. `enum` may be an array of allowed values (of the specified
     * type), or an array of objects with `value` and `description` properties, where
     * the `value` is an allowed value, and the `description` is a descriptive string
     * used in the settings view.
     *
     * In this example, the setting must be one of the 4 integers:
     *
     * ```coffee
     * config:
     *   someSetting:
     *     type: 'integer'
     *     default: 4
     *     enum: [2, 4, 6, 8]
     * ```
     *
     * In this example, the setting must be either 'foo' or 'bar', which are
     * presented using the provided descriptions in the settings pane:
     *
     * ```coffee
     * config:
     *   someSetting:
     *     type: 'string'
     *     default: 'foo'
     *     enum: [
     *       {value: 'foo', description: 'Foo mode. You want this.'}
     *       {value: 'bar', description: 'Bar mode. Nobody wants that!'}
     *     ]
     * ```
     *
     * Usage:
     *
     * ```coffee
     * atom.config.set('my-package.someSetting', '2')
     * atom.config.get('my-package.someSetting') # -> 2
     *
     * # will not set values outside of the enum values
     * atom.config.set('my-package.someSetting', '3')
     * atom.config.get('my-package.someSetting') # -> 2
     *
     * # If it cannot be coerced, the value will not be set
     * atom.config.set('my-package.someSetting', '4')
     * atom.config.get('my-package.someSetting') # -> 4
     * ```
     *
     * #### title and description
     *
     * The settings view will use the `title` and `description` keys to display your
     * config setting in a readable way. By default the settings view humanizes your
     * config key, so `someSetting` becomes `Some Setting`. In some cases, this is
     * confusing for users, and a more descriptive title is useful.
     *
     * Descriptions will be displayed below the title in the settings view.
     *
     * For a group of config settings the humanized key or the title and the
     * description are used for the group headline.
     *
     * ```coffee
     * config:
     *   someSetting:
     *     title: 'Setting Magnitude'
     *     description: 'This will affect the blah and the other blah'
     *     type: 'integer'
     *     default: 4
     * ```
     *
     * __Note__: You should strive to be so clear in your naming of the setting that
     * you do not need to specify a title or description!
     *
     * Descriptions allow a subset of
     * [Markdown formatting](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).
     * Specifically, you may use the following in configuration setting descriptions:
     *
     * * **bold** - `**bold**`
     * * *italics* - `*italics*`
     * * [links](https://atom.io) - `[links](https://atom.io)`
     * * `code spans` - `\`code spans\``
     * * line breaks - `line breaks<br/>`
     * * ~~strikethrough~~ - `~~strikethrough~~`
     *
     * #### order
     *
     * The settings view orders your settings alphabetically. You can override this
     * ordering with the order key.
     *
     * ```coffee
     * config:
     *   zSetting:
     *     type: 'integer'
     *     default: 4
     *     order: 1
     *   aSetting:
     *     type: 'integer'
     *     default: 4
     *     order: 2
     * ```
     *
     * ## Manipulating values outside your configuration schema
     *
     * It is possible to manipulate(`get`, `set`, `observe` etc) values that do not
     * appear in your configuration schema. For example, if the config schema of the
     * package 'some-package' is
     *
     * ```coffee
     * config:
     * someSetting:
     *   type: 'boolean'
     *   default: false
     * ```
     *
     * You can still do the following
     *
     * ```coffee
     * let otherSetting  = atom.config.get('some-package.otherSetting')
     * atom.config.set('some-package.stillAnotherSetting', otherSetting * 5)
     * ```
     *
     * In other words, if a function asks for a `key-path`, that path doesn't have to
     * be described in the config schema for the package or any package. However, as
     * highlighted in the best practices section, you are advised against doing the
     * above.
     *
     * ## Best practices
     *
     * * Don't depend on (or write to) configuration keys outside of your keypath.
     *

         * ```coffee
         * atom.config.get('editor.tabLength', scope: ['source.ruby']) # => 2

     * targets, misspelled words, and anything else that needs to track a logical
     * location in the buffer over time.
     *
     * ### DisplayMarker Creation
     *
     * Use {DisplayMarkerLayer::markBufferRange} or {DisplayMarkerLayer::markScreenRange}
     * rather than creating Markers directly.
     *
     * ### Head and Tail
     *
     * Markers always have a *head* and sometimes have a *tail*. If you think of a
     * marker as an editor selection, the tail is the part that's stationary and the
     * head is the part that moves when the mouse is moved. A marker without a tail
     * always reports an empty range at the head position. A marker with a head position
     * greater than the tail is in a "normal" orientation. If the head precedes the
     * tail the marker is in a "reversed" orientation.
     *
     * ### Validity
     *
     * Markers are considered *valid* when they are first created. Depending on the
     * invalidation strategy you choose, certain changes to the buffer can cause a
     * marker to become invalid, for example if the text surrounding the marker is
     * deleted. The strategies, in order of descending fragility:
     *
     * * __never__: The marker is never marked as invalid. This is a good choice for
     *   markers representing selections in an editor.
     * * __surround__: The marker is invalidated by changes that completely surround it.
     * * __overlap__: The marker is invalidated by changes that surround the
     *   start or end of the marker. This is the default.
     * * __inside__: The marker is invalidated by changes that extend into the
     *   inside of the marker. Changes that end at the marker's start or
     *   start at the marker's end do not invalidate the marker.
     * * __touch__: The marker is invalidated by a change that touches the marked
     *   region in any way, including changes that end at the marker's
     *   start or start at the marker's end. This is the most fragile strategy.
     *
     * See {TextBuffer::markRange} for usage.

     * `::emit`. Instances of this class are intended to be used internally by
     * classes that expose an event-based API.
     *
     * For example:
     *
     * ```coffee
     * class User
     *   constructor: ->
     *     @emitter = new Emitter
     *
     *   onDidChangeName: (callback) ->
     *     @emitter.on 'did-change-name', callback
     *
     *   setName: (name) ->
     *     if name isnt @name
     *       @name = name
     *       @emitter.emit 'did-change-name', name
     *     @name
     * ```

    /**
     * Allows commands to be associated with keystrokes in a
     * context-sensitive way. In Atom, you can access a global instance of this
     * object via `atom.keymaps`.
     *
     * Key bindings are plain JavaScript objects containing **CSS selectors** as
     * their top level keys, then **keystroke patterns** mapped to commands.
     *
     * ```cson
     * '.workspace':
     *   'ctrl-l': 'package:do-something'
     *   'ctrl-z': 'package:do-something-else'
     * '.mini.editor':
     *   'enter': 'core:confirm'
     * ```
     *
     * When a keystroke sequence matches a binding in a given context, a custom DOM
     * event with a type based on the command is dispatched on the target of the
     * keyboard event.
     *
     * To match a keystroke sequence, the keymap starts at the target element for the
     * keyboard event. It looks for key bindings associated with selectors that match
     * the target element. If multiple match, the most specific is selected. If there
     * is a tie in specificity, the most recently added binding wins. If no bindings
     * are found for the events target, the search is repeated again for the target's
     * parent node and so on recursively until a binding is found or we traverse off
     * the top of the document.
     *
     * When a binding is found, its command event is always dispatched on the
     * original target of the keyboard event, even if the matching element is higher
     * up in the DOM. In addition, `.preventDefault()` is called on the keyboard
     * event to prevent the browser from taking action. `.preventDefault` is only
     * called if a matching binding is found.
     *
     * Command event objects have a non-standard method called `.abortKeyBinding()`.
     * If your command handler is invoked but you programmatically determine that no
     * action can be taken and you want to allow other bindings to be matched, call
     * `.abortKeyBinding()` on the event object. An example of where this is useful
     * is binding snippet expansion to `tab`. If `snippets:expand` is invoked when
     * the cursor does not follow a valid snippet prefix, we abort the binding and
     * allow `tab` to be handled by the default handler, which inserts whitespace.
     *
     * Multi-keystroke bindings are possible. If a sequence of one or more keystrokes
     * *partially* matches a multi-keystroke binding, the keymap enters a pending
     * state. The pending state is terminated on the next keystroke, or after
     * {::partialMatchTimeout} milliseconds has elapsed. When the pending state is
     * terminated via a timeout or a keystroke that leads to no matches, the longest
     * ambiguous bindings that caused the pending state are temporarily disabled and
     * the previous keystrokes are replayed. If there is ambiguity again during the
     * replay, the next longest bindings are disabled and the keystrokes are replayed
     * again.

     * A single {TextBuffer} can belong to multiple editors. For example, if the

     * each pane. If the buffer is manipulated the changes are reflected in both

     *
     * The easiest way to get hold of `TextEditor` objects is by registering a callback
     * with `::observeTextEditors` on the `atom.workspace` global. Your callback will

     *
     * ## Buffer vs. Screen Coordinates
     *
     * Because editors support folds and soft-wrapping, the lines on screen don't
     * always match the lines in the buffer. For example, a long line that soft wraps
     * twice renders as three lines on screen, but only represents one line in the
     * buffer. Similarly, if rows 5-10 are folded, then row 6 on screen corresponds
     * to row 11 in the buffer.
     *
     * Your choice of coordinates systems will depend on what you're trying to
     * achieve. For example, if you're writing a command that jumps the cursor up or
     * down by 10 lines, you'll want to use screen coordinates because the user
     * probably wants to skip lines *on screen*. However, if you're writing a package
     * that jumps between method definitions, you'll want to work in buffer
     * coordinates.
     *
     * **When in doubt, just default to buffer coordinates**, then experiment with
     * soft wraps and folds to ensure your code interacts with them correctly.

        example, perhaps you wish to preview a rendered version of the file `/foo/bar/baz.quux`
        that is already open in a text editor view. You could signal this by calling
        {Workspace::open} on the URI `quux-preview://foo/bar/baz.quux`. Then your opener
        can check the protocol for quux-preview and only handle those URIs that match.
